# Soft Lights — VS Code Theme

**Soft Lights** is a gentle, refined color theme for Visual Studio Code.  
It is a *minor, tastefully balanced* alteration of the **Field Lights (Ayu Mirage)** theme, designed for users who enjoy a soft, low-contrast environment with warm undertones and comfortable readability.

If you love Ayu Mirage but want something calmer, smoother, and easier on the eyes for long coding sessions—Soft Lights might be for you.
